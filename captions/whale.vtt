00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.960
ï»¿In the 1600s, there were so many right whales&nbsp;
in Cape Cod Bay off the east coast of the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.360
that apparently you could walk across their backs&nbsp;
from one end of the bay to the other. Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.200
they number in the hundreds, and&nbsp;
they're endangered. Like them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.000
many species of whales saw their numbers&nbsp;
drastically reduced by 200 years of whaling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.280
where they were hunted and killed for&nbsp;
their whale meat, oil and whale bone.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.760
We only have whales in our waters today because&nbsp;
of the Save the Whales movement of the '70s.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.640
It was instrumental in stopping commercial&nbsp;
whaling, and was built on the idea that if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.040
we couldn't save whales, what could we save? It&nbsp;
was ultimately a test of our political ability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.160
to halt environmental destruction. So in the&nbsp;
early '80s, there was a ban on commercial whaling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.080
that came into force as a result of this campaign.&nbsp;
Whales in our waters are still low in numbers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.320
however, because they do face a range&nbsp;
of other human-induced threats.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.760
Unfortunately, many people still think that&nbsp;
whale conservationists like myself do what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.880
do only because these creatures are charismatic&nbsp;
and beautiful. This is actually a disservice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.520
because whales are ecosystem engineers.&nbsp;
They help maintain the stability and health&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.920
of the oceans, and even provide&nbsp;
services to human society.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.120
So let's talk about why saving whales is&nbsp;
critical to the resiliency of the oceans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.520
It boils down to two main things:&nbsp;
whale poop and rotting carcasses.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.760
As whales dive to the depths to feed&nbsp;
and come up to the surface to breathe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.680
they actually release these enormous fecal&nbsp;
plumes. This whale pump, as it's called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.880
actually brings essential limiting nutrients&nbsp;
from the depths to the surface waters where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.640
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, which forms&nbsp;
the base of all marine food chains. So really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.000
having more whales in the oceans pooping is&nbsp;
really beneficial to the entire ecosystem.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.000
Whales are also known to undertake some of the&nbsp;
longest migrations of all mammals. Gray whales&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.400
off America migrate 16,000 kilometers between&nbsp;
productive feeding areas and less productive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.680
calving, or birthing, areas and back every year.&nbsp;
As they do so, they transport fertilizer in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.240
form of their feces from places that have it to&nbsp;
places that need it. So clearly, whales are really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.280
important in nutrient cycling, both horizontally&nbsp;
and vertically, through the oceans.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.560
But what's really cool is that they're&nbsp;
also really important after they're dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.720
Whale carcasses are some of the largest form&nbsp;
of detritus to fall from the ocean's surface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.600
and they're called whale fall. As these carcasses&nbsp;
sink, they provide a feast to some 400-odd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.360
species, including the eel-shaped, slime-producing&nbsp;
hagfish. So over the 200 years of whaling, when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.480
were busy killing and removing these carcasses&nbsp;
from the oceans, we likely altered the rate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.560
geographic distribution of these whale falls that&nbsp;
would descend into deep oceans, and as a result,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.880
probably led to a number of extinctions of species&nbsp;
that were most specialized and dependent on these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.400
carcasses for their survival.
Whale carcasses are also known to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.160
transport about 190,000 tons of carbon,&nbsp;
which is the equivalent of that produced by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.240
80,000 cars per year from the atmosphere to the&nbsp;
deep oceans, and the deep oceans are what we call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.640
"carbon sinks," because they trap and hold excess&nbsp;
carbon from the atmosphere, and therefore help to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:32.640
delay global warming. Sometimes these carcasses&nbsp;
also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:40.400
a number of predatory species on land.
The 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.800
and caused a reduction in the populations&nbsp;
of whales between 60 to 90 percent.Clearly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.120
the Save the Whales movement was instrumental in&nbsp;
preventing commercial whaling from going on, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.840
we need to revise this. We need to address the&nbsp;
more modern, pressing problems that these whales&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.840
face in our waters today. Amongst other things,&nbsp;
we need to stop them from getting plowed down by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.960
container ships when they're in their feeding&nbsp;
areas, and stop them from getting entangled in&nbsp;

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.440
fishing nets as they float around in the ocean.&nbsp;
We also need to learn to contextualize our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.720
conservation messages, so people really understand&nbsp;
the true ecosystem value of these creatures.&nbsp;

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.120
So, let's save the whales again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.000
but this time, let's not just do it for&nbsp;
their sake. Let's also do it for ours.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.337
Thank you.
