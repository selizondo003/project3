00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.960
In the 1600s, there were so many right whales 
in Cape Cod Bay off the east coast of the U.S. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.360
that apparently you could walk across their backs 
from one end of the bay to the other. Today, 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.200
they number in the hundreds, and 
they're endangered. Like them, 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.000
many species of whales saw their numbers 
drastically reduced by 200 years of whaling, 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.280
where they were hunted and killed for 
their whale meat, oil and whale bone.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.760
We only have whales in our waters today because 
of the Save the Whales movement of the '70s. 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.640
It was instrumental in stopping commercial 
whaling, and was built on the idea that if 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.040
we couldn't save whales, what could we save? It 
was ultimately a test of our political ability 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.160
to halt environmental destruction. So in the 
early '80s, there was a ban on commercial whaling 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.080
that came into force as a result of this campaign. 
Whales in our waters are still low in numbers, 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.320
however, because they do face a range 
of other human-induced threats.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.760
Unfortunately, many people still think that 
whale conservationists like myself do what we 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.880
do only because these creatures are charismatic 
and beautiful. This is actually a disservice, 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.520
because whales are ecosystem engineers. 
They help maintain the stability and health 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.920
of the oceans, and even provide 
services to human society.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.120
So let's talk about why saving whales is 
critical to the resiliency of the oceans. 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.520
It boils down to two main things: 
whale poop and rotting carcasses.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.760
As whales dive to the depths to feed 
and come up to the surface to breathe, 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.680
they actually release these enormous fecal 
plumes. This whale pump, as it's called, 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.880
actually brings essential limiting nutrients 
from the depths to the surface waters where they 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.640
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, which forms 
the base of all marine food chains. So really, 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.000
having more whales in the oceans pooping is 
really beneficial to the entire ecosystem.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.000
Whales are also known to undertake some of the 
longest migrations of all mammals. Gray whales 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.400
off America migrate 16,000 kilometers between 
productive feeding areas and less productive 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.680
calving, or birthing, areas and back every year. 
As they do so, they transport fertilizer in the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.240
form of their feces from places that have it to 
places that need it. So clearly, whales are really 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.280
important in nutrient cycling, both horizontally 
and vertically, through the oceans.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.560
But what's really cool is that they're 
also really important after they're dead. 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.720
Whale carcasses are some of the largest form 
of detritus to fall from the ocean's surface, 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.600
and they're called whale fall. As these carcasses 
sink, they provide a feast to some 400-odd 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.360
species, including the eel-shaped, slime-producing 
hagfish. So over the 200 years of whaling, when we 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.480
were busy killing and removing these carcasses 
from the oceans, we likely altered the rate and 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.560
geographic distribution of these whale falls that 
would descend into deep oceans, and as a result, 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.880
probably led to a number of extinctions of species 
that were most specialized and dependent on these 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.400
carcasses for their survival.
Whale carcasses are also known to 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.160
transport about 190,000 tons of carbon, 
which is the equivalent of that produced by 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.240
80,000 cars per year from the atmosphere to the 
deep oceans, and the deep oceans are what we call 

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.640
"carbon sinks," because they trap and hold excess 
carbon from the atmosphere, and therefore help to 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:32.640
delay global warming. Sometimes these carcasses 
also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:40.400
a number of predatory species on land.
The 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.800
and caused a reduction in the populations 
of whales between 60 to 90 percent.Clearly, 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.120
the Save the Whales movement was instrumental in 
preventing commercial whaling from going on, but 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.840
we need to revise this. We need to address the 
more modern, pressing problems that these whales 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.840
face in our waters today. Amongst other things, 
we need to stop them from getting plowed down by 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.960
container ships when they're in their feeding 
areas, and stop them from getting entangled in 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.440
fishing nets as they float around in the ocean. 
We also need to learn to contextualize our 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.720
conservation messages, so people really understand 
the true ecosystem value of these creatures. 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.120
So, let's save the whales again, 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.000
but this time, let's not just do it for 
their sake. Let's also do it for ours.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.337
Thank you.
